## How to
```
git clone https://github.com/ekosz/reprocessing-example-flow-field.git
```

### Install

npm install
```

### Build
```
npm run build
```

### Start
```
npm start
```

To build to JS run `npm run build:web` (no need to run `npm start`) and then open `index.html` in a static server, like `npx http-server` and go to `localhost:8080`. If you're using safari you can simply open the `index.html` and tick `Develop > Disable Cross-Origin Restrictions`.

To build to native run `npm run build:native` and run `npm run start:native`

The build system used is [bsb-native](https://github.com/bsansouci/bsb-native).
